# Diffie-Hellman-algorithm
The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. This shared key can then be used for secure communication between the parties. The code implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and simulates a communication between two users.
